# sciml-workshop
Practical notebooks for the SciML workshop

## Google Colab
### Directions for setup

* Go to colab [https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/intro.ipynb](https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/intro.ipynb)
*	File → Open Notebook
*	Click tab "Github"
*	In the search box enter https://github.com/stfc-ai4s/sciml-workshop-tf
*	Scroll down and choose the appropriate lesson
*	Authorise yourself with Google.

### Notes while running
* At the **start** of the session make sure you are running a GPU. NB - if you go back and change this the notebook will have to restart.
    * Runtime → Runtime Type → Hardware Accelerator = GPU
* If you wish to keep a copy with saved changes, there are two options:
   * To download the notebook to your computer: File → Download .ipynb
   * To save a copy in your Google Drive: File → Save a copy in Drive

## SCD Cloud
