We also have the time that the acceleration has been running for and finally we have an estimate of the number of the profile.\n","\n","The aim of this work is to take the results of the low cost simulation and using the LSTM make them match more closely to the high cost accurate simulation - which is your ground truth Y values in this example. To give a sense of the sppedup, the low cost simulations take about 1 second to run, the ground truth simulations take about 16 hours each.\n","\n","The data for this practical is plotted below.
